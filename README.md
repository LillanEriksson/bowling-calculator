# Bowling-calculator

React and redux bowling-calculator. Styling with styled-components.

Still left todo & my thoughts about it:
-Find out why the scorecount is not accurate. Somehow I'm not getting the strike and block right.
Probably because I set the strike and block to null in the beginning of the handleRoll-function. But where to put it?
-Fix adding extra points for strike and block to index allscores.length -2 ?
-Get component TotalScore to show the actual total score
-Fix the last round (it should be 3 rolls, now there are only two)
-A bit more styling would look nice
-Testing, would have loved to do more! Did some basic ones just to try it out,

...and I'm aware that the indentation is totally off. Having problems with VSCode.
