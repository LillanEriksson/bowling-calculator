# Bowling-calculator

React and redux bowling-calculator. Styling with styled-components.

Still left todo:
-Fix adding points for strike and block
-Get component TotalScore to show the actual total score
-Fix the last round (it should be 3 rolls, now there are only two)
-A bit more styling would look nice
-Testing

...and I'm aware that the indentation is totally off. Having problems with VSCode.
